## Never miss the coolest things around you

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/diskover](https://assembly.com/diskover).

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.

The simplest way to describe the idea is by saying that it is focused on giving to the user all the near activities that he can find on any interest.

##Technical

For the moment we have here a RESTful API using Node, Express 4 and its Router, and Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB instance.

express is the Node framework. 
mongoose is the ORM we will use to communicate with our MongoDB database. 
body-parser will let us pull POST content from our HTTP request.

To install the application run:
npm install
